## Introduction

This is the QMK firmware repository for the Doddle60, updated until [revision Alpha](https://github.com/Gondolindrim/Doddle60/releases/tag/Alpha).

The Doddle60 is an Open-Hardware guidelines compliant PCB which files can be found at [this link](https://github.com/Gondolindrim/Doddle60). Its designer and maintainer is [Gondolindrim](https://github.com/Gondolindrim).

Doddle60 is a collaboration between Gondolindrim and Jae, TopClack host, to bring a plain-style PCB to the ISO layout. See the [IC page](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=103057) for further information; a Group Buy of 15 units was made and, as of April 2020, that was the only way to obtain a Doddle60. However, Jae pretends to stock this PCB at his store.
